middleware

## jargon
seperation of concerns.

_we do not write code for the computer, code is a communicator, way to reveal our intentions to the next dev_

_optimize for readability_

## everything is middleware!

types( based on how we got it or who built it )

- built in: included in express ex: 'express.json'
- 3rd party: must be installed from 'npm' 
- custom: we code this!

## types (based on how its being used)

- global: runs on every request
- 

order matters, top-bottom (left-right)
